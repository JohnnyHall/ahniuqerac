> Repository created in college during web development class to learn github basics

## 🎯 Objective

      On Github or Gitlab:
       ↳ Someone on the team create a project/repository;
       ↳ Share with the other elements of the group formed in the classroom;
       ↳ Armed with your studies of gitflow, choose a way to apply it to your new project;
       ↳ Create initial code in the customer delivery branch;
       ↳ Use this code base to create new branches;
       ↳ Each developer will do their development within their S BranchES.
       ↳ As the project progresses, it is important to carry out unit and integration tests.
       ↳ At the end, please generate a v1.0 version of your code and make it available for download.
       ↳ Provide/Elaborate a readme.
       ↳ Make use of code review in non-automatic merges.
        
      Problem: Create a project in C language that:
       ↳ Generate/Create an integer array with 1000 entries;
       ↳ Generate functions that:
           ↳ Fill these thousand positions in the vector through a function that generates random numbers and inserts them into the vector.
           ↳ Sort this vector with the sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort.
           ↳ Sort this vector with the sorting algorithm called Quick Sort.
           ↳ Print this vector;
           ↳ Take the average of the vector;
           ↳ Take the median of the vector;
           ↳ Say what is the largest value present in the vector?
           ↳ Say what is the smallest value present in the vector?
       ↳ All these functions print their results to the screen directly.
