> Repository created in college during web development class to learn github basics

## üéØ Objective

      On Github or Gitlab:
       ‚Ü≥ Someone on the team create a project/repository;
       ‚Ü≥ Share with the other elements of the group formed in the classroom;
       ‚Ü≥ Armed with your studies of gitflow, choose a way to apply it to your new project;
       ‚Ü≥ Create initial code in the customer delivery branch;
       ‚Ü≥ Use this code base to create new branches;
       ‚Ü≥ Each developer will do their development within their S BranchES.
       ‚Ü≥ As the project progresses, it is important to carry out unit and integration tests.
       ‚Ü≥ At the end, please generate a v1.0 version of your code and make it available for download.
       ‚Ü≥ Provide/Elaborate a readme.
       ‚Ü≥ Make use of code review in non-automatic merges.
        
      Problem: Create a project in C language that:
       ‚Ü≥ Generate/Create an integer array with 1000 entries;
       ‚Ü≥ Generate functions that:
           ‚Ü≥ Fill these thousand positions in the vector through a function that generates random numbers and inserts them into the vector.
           ‚Ü≥ Sort this vector with the sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort.
           ‚Ü≥ Sort this vector with the sorting algorithm called Quick Sort.
           ‚Ü≥ Print this vector;
           ‚Ü≥ Take the average of the vector;
           ‚Ü≥ Take the median of the vector;
           ‚Ü≥ Say what is the largest value present in the vector?
           ‚Ü≥ Say what is the smallest value present in the vector?
       ‚Ü≥ All these functions print their results to the screen directly.
